# The First Mile
At Flatiron School, we call Days 1 - 14 (beginning on the cohort start date) the First Mile. The First Mile is designed for you to experience what it’s like to be a Flatiron cohort student. In those first 14 calendar days (including weekends), all students are required to complete the First Mile action items in their current cohort in order to continue on with the cohort. 

This link contains a series of videos with everything you’ll need to know in order to get started, including the First Mile action items required by all students in order to remain in the cohort:

1. Complete all assigned First Mile lessons on time
2. Attend (or watch) Orientation
3. Attend (or watch) Pair Programming Demo
4. Schedule and attend a 1:1 with a member of your support team during the First Mile
5. Publish your first blog post and submit the URL for credit

Any student who does not complete all First Mile action items during the first 14 days will be required to leave the cohort in accordance with the Program Change Policy, found in the “Program Changes” section in the Flatiron School Catalog, which can be viewed by clicking on “View the full United states catalog” here: [https://flatironschool.com/north-america-regulatory-information/](https://flatironschool.com/north-america-regulatory-information/).

# Portfolio Projects & Project Reviews
Each major section of the curriculum concludes with a comprehensive Portfolio Project meant to demonstrate your learnings, where you will build a web application from start to finish. For each project, you’ll complete a 1:1 Project Review to ensure that you’ve mastered key concepts before progressing to the next section. Cohort Leads are ready to provide additional mentorship if you need help deepening your understanding.

Throughout the course, you will be required to complete five Portfolio Projects (in the following order), each with a unique set of technical requirements. Full-time students should plan to spend 5-7 days on each project, and part-time students, about 2 weeks on each project.
* CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project
* Sinatra Portfolio Project
* Rails Portfolio Project
* Rails with JavaScript Portfolio Project
* React Redux Final Project

Project Reviews are pass/fail (not numerically graded) and are used to evaluate your readiness to progress to the next Section. During a Project Review, you will be asked to show and discuss what you have built. Expect to walk through your code live, and be comfortable answering questions about your process, as well as other concepts covered in the curriculum. A list of the project requirements and topics to be covered can be found in each project lesson. You will pass your project review if:
1. You have built a project that meets the technical requirements;
2. You can explain in detail what your code is doing and how it works;
3. You can satisfactorily demonstrate understanding of the core concepts from previous portions of the course

You will be informed at the end of the project review session whether you have passed or not. If you do not pass the review satisfactorily on your first attempt, you will have the opportunity to reschedule the review.

Note:  All students will be given two attempts to pass a Portfolio Project review within two weeks of the project due date. If you’re unable to pass the review within two weeks of the project due date, you will have the option to repeat the module in accordance with the policies outlined in the “Program Changes” section in the Flatiron School Catalog, which can be viewed by clicking on “View the full United states catalog” here: [https://flatironschool.com/north-america-regulatory-information/](https://flatironschool.com/north-america-regulatory-information/).
